To test this approach, I held out one model — Model 3299 — as a test case.
This model had an actual Gini gain of 29.75%, and it saved the business $3.1 million.
From this, we can compute the implied gain per Gini: about $0.104 million per percentage point.
I used my framework to predict the Gini improvement, and while the predicted gain was slightly higher than the actual, it was quite close.
Multiplying the actual Gini gain by the gain-per-point gives a performance-linked gain estimate of $1.09 million.
I’m still finalizing the training cost estimate for this model, but this early result shows that
the framework can reasonably estimate financial impact based on just data complexity and prior scale.
