In practice, newer versions of predictive models are usually developed by making one or more of the following changes:

1. Switching to more advanced algorithms,


2. Adding more data,


3. Modifying or engineering features.



While these changes typically result in improved model performance, they also come at a high cost.

Development and validation cycles can span several months,

They require significant human and computational resources,

And the incremental performance gain may not always justify these investments.


Therefore, the central question of this project is:

> Is the performance improvement from updating algorithms, data, or features worth the associated cost?
