To evaluate whether model updates are worth the cost, I decompose the overall question into three sub-problems:

What is the performance gain and cost from switching to a more advanced algorithm?

What is the gain and cost from adding more data?

What is the gain and cost from changing or engineering new features?

To ensure fair comparison, I study each factor in isolation, holding the other two constant.

I focus on a class of models known as low impact fraud models, because:

They address similar business problems,

Share comparable data structures and modeling constraints,

And offer a stable testing ground to identify generalizable patterns.

✅ I’ve already completed the analysis for the first part: evaluating the cost-benefit of algorithm changes.
