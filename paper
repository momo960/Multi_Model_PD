Although the framework already delivers decision-grade accuracy, two obvious gaps limit its scope and statistical power. Addressing them will sharpen the methodology and broaden its business relevance.

6.1 Model-Refresh Timing: Data Freshness

Why it matters. In many portfolios, simply retraining on newer records can boost Gini by 0.5–2 pp without any other change. Ignoring this dimension leaves money—and sometimes risk reduction—on the table.

Current state. Data-freshness impact was treated as neutral in the Gen 6 → Gen 7 back-test (§ 4.2) because no proxy is yet defined.

Next steps.

Age-stratified re-train experiments on at least three models to measure how Gini drifts with record age.

Fit a time-decay curve (e.g., exponential) using simple proxies such as average record age, business-cycle volatility, or target-rate drift.

Integrate the curve into the cost-benefit engine so that “retrain now vs. later” becomes an explicit option alongside algorithm, data size, and feature changes.

6.2 Sample Size: From Seven Models to a Portfolio-Scale Corpus

Limitation. Seven datasets provide only enough degrees of freedom for one-factor regressions. More models would allow multi-factor equations and formal validation splits.

Expansion plan.

Onboard 20–30 additional fraud and marketing models (including challenger proofs of concept) to diversify event rates, dimensionality, and baseline Gini.

Re-estimate the ALG, SIZE, and FEAT equations with regularised multivariate regressions—e.g., elastic-net—to capture interaction effects without over-fit.

Reserve 20 % of the enlarged corpus as a hold-out portfolio test, giving management a clear view of out-of-sample robustness.
