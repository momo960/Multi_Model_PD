Performance gains are only half of the equation; a model upgrade is worthwhile only if the incremental benefit exceeds the incremental cost. We quantify cost along two practical axes—computation and labour—during the development → validation pipeline. Governance, monitoring, and production-run‐time costs are comparable across algorithms in our environment and are therefore excluded.

Cost component	Metric	Typical scale	Notes
Computational	$ per training iteration	$10 – 15	75 M rows × 100 iterations ≈ $1 k; difference between LR and XGB is a few hundred dollars—negligible relative to labour.
Labour	Person-hours × hourly rate	10³–10⁴ hrs	Dominated by feature crafting, hyper-parameter search, documentation, interpretability, and independent model-risk validation (MRV).
3.2.1 Labour-Cost Template

From internal project logs we derived typical effort envelopes:

Algorithm	Development (DEV)	Validation (VAL)
Logistic Regression	3 months	1 month
XGBoost	6 months	3 months

Assumptions for unit costing (can be localised per institution):

Primary modeller 1 FTE at $100 / hour, 7 h × 5 d × 4.3 wk / month

Supporting analyst 0.33 FTE at same rate
