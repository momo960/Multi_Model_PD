Why start with the algorithm itself?
In production we often face a choice between keeping a well-understood Logistic Regression and upgrading to a more powerful—but costlier—tree or neural model. The practical question is not “Which algorithm is best in theory?” but “How much extra lift will a complex model actually buy us on this dataset?”
The following section shows how a two-minute Logistic Regression run can act as a proxy for hidden non-linearity, allowing us to forecast the LR → XGB uplift without building the XGB first.

Why isolate data volume?
Adding rows is usually the safest way to improve performance, yet the benefit tails off and the storage / re-processing bill climbs quickly. What we need is a curve that tells us, for any given model, whether the next million records are worth ingesting.
The next pages derive that curve—using a three-parameter power law—and show how two cheap statistics (event rate and separability) are enough to estimate its shape in advance.

Why focus on one feature at a time?
Feature work is the most labour-intensive part of model development, but most proposed variables never make it to production. Before an analyst burns a week engineering a new field, management wants to know the likely payoff.
This section introduces a relevance–redundancy score that predicts the Gini change from adding (or dropping) a single feature, using numbers that can be calculated in minutes from existing data.
