This white paper has presented a practical, numbers-driven framework for answering a question every modelling team faces: “Is a proposed upgrade really worth it?”

Three transparent formulas deliver instant Gini-uplift estimates

Algorithm switch (LR → XGB). A single non-linearity proxy—Mismatch—predicts the uplift with < 2 pp error across fraud and marketing datasets.

Adding data. A three-parameter power-law, whose coefficients come from event rate and separability, reproduces each learning curve within ~2 pp.

Adding features. A relevance-minus-redundancy rule, built from univariate Gini and a simple CorrScore, forecasts single-feature impact with ~0.3 pp error.

Predicted Gini gain becomes predicted dollar gain by multiplying with a business-specific Gini-to-Dollar factor extracted from past challenger wins.

Incremental cost is quantified—primarily labour time, secondarily computation—and compared with the dollar benefit to obtain a breakeven threshold.

Back-testing on an actual production release (Model 1119 Gen 6 → Gen 7) showed the framework missed the realised uplift by only 0.7 pp—well inside governance tolerance—while requiring less than an hour of analyst effort.

What the framework gives the business

Speed. Early go/no-go guidance without months of experimentation.

Transparency. Each equation links directly to an intuitive data property—no black-box meta-models.

Consistency. A single yard-stick for algorithm changes, data-expansion requests, and feature-engineering pitches.

Limitations and next steps

Data freshness and feature reduction effects are still handled by assumptions; future work will add explicit proxies for both.

Extension beyond XGBoost—e.g., to neural networks—requires new calibration but no structural change.

Automating proxy extraction and report generation would embed the framework directly into the model-governance pipeline.

With these enhancements, the framework can become a standing control that keeps model-development resources focused where they deliver the greatest business value.
