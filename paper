Different product lines turn a point of Gini uplift into very different amounts of money.
To compare any enhancement with its cost, the framework therefore calculates a model-specific Gini-to-Dollar factor, κ, and then applies a simple break-even rule.

1 Derive κ once per business model

From the last champion-vs-challenger release notes we read:

the reported Gini gain (e.g., +4.2 pp)

the reported dollar benefit (e.g., $38 million saved)

Their ratio is

𝜅
  
=
  
dollar benefit
Gini gain
[
dollars per 1 pp Gini
]
.
κ=
Gini gain
dollar benefit
	​

[dollars per 1 pp Gini].

Fraud portfolios typically yield a high κ; small-scale marketing campaigns a much lower one.
Because the source is business-approved documentation, κ already reflects portfolio size, loss rates, approval policies, etc.

3 Compare benefit with incremental cost

From Section 3.2 we know the extra spend, ΔCost, required to deliver the change.
The decision rule is straightforward:

Accept the enhancement if

otherwise defer or reject.
