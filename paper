To see how the framework performs outside the lab, we retro-fitted it to an actual production change: the move from Generation 6 to Generation 7 of fraud Model 1119.
That release introduced three modifications—fresher data, a handful of new variables, and the retirement of some low-impact variables. Only the new-variable piece falls within the scope of the current framework, so we treated the other two changes as neutral and focused on what the Feature module could tell us.

Using the relevance-minus-redundancy equation from § 3.1.3, the framework forecast a 2.0-point Gini lift once the extra variables were added. When Gen 7 went live, business monitoring reported a 2.7-point lift on the identical out-of-time window—just 0.7 points above the projection, well inside the ±1 pp tolerance that model-risk governance regards as “on target.”

The back-test illustrates two practical advantages. First, the proxy-based estimate was good enough to clear the break-even hurdle (1.4 pp for this portfolio), which would have justified the development spend had the framework been consulted beforehand. Second, the estimate took less than an hour to produce, compared with the six months the full Gen 7 build actually consumed. In short, even without modelling every conceivable factor, the framework offered an early, low-cost and remarkably accurate read on whether the upgrade would pay off—a strong signal of its value in real-world decision making.
