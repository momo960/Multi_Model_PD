The final step converts a technical metric (Gini uplift) into the financial metric (dollar gain) that business owners care about.
Because each product line—fraud, marketing, credit risk—operates at a different scale, we compute a model-specific Gini-to-Dollar conversion rate directly from historic champion-versus-challenger results documented by the modelling teams.

3.3.1 Deriving the Conversion Factor κ

For every production model
